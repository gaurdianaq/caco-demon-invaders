Note this probably doesn't build anymore due to using such an old version of unity.

# Cacodemon Invaders

This was a RAD (Rapid Application Development) Port project for our Game Component Integration class in the GDP Program at Fanshawe College for the 2018-19 school year.
It is a Space Invaders type game clone, where the objective of the game is to shoot the enemies at the top of the screen while avoiding enemy fire. You recieve points for each enemy you kill and die right away if you are hit by an enemy attack.

## Getting Started

- Clone/Download this repository to your machine.
- Open the project either using the Unity GUI or by clicking on the .unity file in the Assets/Scenes folder (titlescreen.unity)
- If opening the project in Unity, to play make sure the title screen scene is selected and press the Play button at the top of the screen
- You can also build it as an .exe file by going to File > Build Settings

## Controls

- NOTE: These also appear on the game title screen.
- A and D move the player left and right at the bottom of the screen.
- SPACE fires the players weapon
- Enter starts the game and returns to the title screen on game completion.

## Built With

- [Unity 2018.2.18](https://unity3d.com/)
